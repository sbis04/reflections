1) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

When I want to collaborate with other on project I would push my local repo to
GitHub. I may also want to store on GitHub to gain access to the files from any
computer around the world.

2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Pulling changes manually would not cause unexpected pulling of wrong editing
so I think manual pulling would be a better option than pulling automatically from
GitHub.
