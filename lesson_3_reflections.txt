1) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

When I want to collaborate with other on project I would push my local repo to
GitHub. I may also want to store on GitHub to gain access to the files from any
computer around the world.

2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Pulling changes manually would not cause unexpected pulling of wrong editing
so I think manual pulling would be a better option than pulling automatically from
GitHub.

3) Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you
use one instead of another?

Forks are used within GitHub server. Clones are used both within GitHub and in
our local computer. Branches are used within a repository. We would use fork within
GitHub but not in my own computer.

4) What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

Having last known copy helps to keep the repo on the computer and on GitHub
syncronized so that we can know which files are on GitHub and which are in our
computer still to be pushed to GitHub.

5) How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

I can collaborate with others without using GitHub by sending the files to each
collaborators or uploading to Google Drive and share it with other collaborators.
But these ways would be much difficult and would lead to mistakes in the future,
so GitHub is the most convenient way to collaborate.

6) When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly
in master? What benefits does each approach have?

When we work on different features of any project that we are not sure whether it
would work properly or not not we might not want to add it to the master branch as
some would collaborate and work on that part of the branch.
Making changes in separate branches, rather than directly on the master, keeps the
things organized. Later we can merge the branches into the master that we want to
add in our main project.
